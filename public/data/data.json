The FDM or FFD machines use filaments of a wide range of thermoplastics polymers, whereas the SLA machines use liquid photopolymer resins that mimic polymers such as ABS, PP and mainly PMMA (Acrylic) plastics. For metal printing, it is possible to produce intricate and super efficient forms and structures using advanced alloys: Stainless Steels, Titanium, Aluminium, Nickel based alloys: Inconel, Monel and more.</p><p>Your choice of material will no doubt depend on the application, but generally for plastics the FDM machines will make cost effective, stronger and more functional items whereas the SLA machines will produce more detailed, semi-functional parts. By semi-functional we mean they will be fit to demonstrate how a product will work but will not match the ‘strength’ of their FDM equivalents. Metal components are fully functional but are high cost.</p><p>Further, we are increasingly integrating Reaction Injection Moulding, RIM processes into our repertoire of manufacturing processes. Although not an AM process, it is certainly worth considering if you are intending to make volumes upwards of a handful, if geometrically feasible and economically viable. The materials used, poly-urethanes and silicone produce both high quality parts with high performing mechanical properties – they are fit for extreme conditions experienced in desert, polar and marine environments.</p>"

Crucially, both the exterior and interior profiles and structure of the part are constructed. Complex forms and geometrical features such as overhangs, blended surfaces, thread forms, cavities and much more can be deposited in one print operation. Further, it is possible to print mating or near readily assembled parts such as gears, hinges, chain links, housed bearings, all in one go. In fact this manufacturing method seems to provide boundless possibilities.
